## Description 

An E-commerce Bookstore Application meant to showcase the use of <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> frontend javascript framework, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SASS</a> CSS preprocessor and <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Library API</a> as a backend for data consumption. Project is focused on frontend web development featuring the use of latest industry standards and best practices. Application includes responsive web design, web accessibility and performance optimizations as well as showcasing the usage of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>'s rich ecosystem.

Functionality includes custom homepage carousel, custom double slider, the ability to fetch data from Openlibrary database based on chosen book genre as well as to filter the supplied data by price. Books available in the store are able to be added to the cart, from which they can be increased or decreased in quantity, as well as removed from the cart completely. State management is implemented with react's native redux-like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context API</a>, async-await is used for asynchronous data fetching and the whole project is based on functional programming paradigm using functional components. Testing is handled by using snapshot tests with Jest/Enzyme.
